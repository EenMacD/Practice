# Practice

The intention of this repo is to learn concepts in Go that I will be using in practice


I have a nextjs app - I want to create functionality in python, that handles the backend - aunthenticate, mint, funtionality. 

Connect google email api, from the backend, to allow sending of email.

set up the authenticate server that mints to quorum blockchain when it receives the email,

set up a form that inputs user details that specifies where email needs to go

set up a blockchain explorer that allows transaction Id to be verified.
